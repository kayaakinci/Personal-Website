        <div class = 'readMe'>Created an application that loops through tens of thousands of daily flight data (using a real-time flight tracking API) and finds the airports that have the highest percentage of delayed flights. Flight travelers can use the data to catch trends on which airports to fly through on which specific day. I have also been keeping track of previous days' flight data so that passengers can see which airports from the past tend to be the busiest on which specific days so that those passengers could avoid those airports when deciding where to fly to.
